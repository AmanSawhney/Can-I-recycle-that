<h1>The Herricks High School Recycling App </h1>

<h2> The Problems </h2>
In most high schools getting kids excited about recycling is a major problem.  The majority of recyclable waste is through into landfills.  The aforementioned applies to Herricks High School; on average, a classroom's trash is 76% recyclable.  The problem is caused by a various of reason, but this app attempts to address two:
<ol>
<li> Understanding what is recyclable </li>
<li> Giving incentive to recycle </li>
</ol>
<h2> How does it solve these problems </h2>
<h3> 1. Understanding what is recyclable </h3>
The app features a barcode scanner which allows students to scan and the various products they are attempting to recycle, and the app then queries a database with the string given from the barcode and returns with a message telling the user if the product was recyclable.

<h3> 2. Giving incentive to recycle </h3>
The app purposely has banner ads.  These ads provide the app revenue, and through this revenue, the app produces money that can then be used to purchase a gift card.  These cards will be given to the user who logs the most recycled objects throughout the day, giving students incentive.  
<h2> What is next? </h2>
I plan to integrate leaderboard and scores to further "gamify" the experience and get more kids excited about recycling!
